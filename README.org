anki-editor -- Make Anki Cards in Org-mode

* Installation

  *Requirements*
  - [[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect#installation][anki-connect]],
    an Anki add-on required by this package to interact with Anki.
  - curl

  If you have [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] in your =package-archives=,
    just =M-x package-install RET anki-editor RET=, or install it
    manually by downloading and visiting [[anki-editor.el]] in your
    emacs buffer, and =M-x package-install-from-buffer RET=.

* Usage

** The Syntax

   Now you can compose Anki notes in Org syntax, e.g. lists, code
   blocks, tables, latex fragments / environments, when being
   submitted to Anki, they will be converted to HTML by Org-mode's
   HTML backend with specific markers (e.g. latex) translated to the
   Anki style.

   The structure of contents is as follow, which is inspired by
   =org-drill=. See [[./examples.org][examples.org]] for reference.

   #+END_EXAMPLE

   - Headings of deck are tagged with =deck=
   - Headings of note are tagged with =note=
   - Levels are not significant, but note headings must be descendents
     of their deck headings
   - Custom properties of a note heading can be used to specify note
     type and tags
   - Subheadings of a note heading are fields of its note type
